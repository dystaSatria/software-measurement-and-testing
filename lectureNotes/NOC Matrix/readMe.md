# NOC Matrix (Chidamber & Kemerer)


## Overview

The "Number of Children" (NOC) is one of the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics used in software engineering to evaluate the complexity of object-oriented software. In the context of our NOC (Network on Chip) project, this metric provides insights into the inheritance hierarchy of our classes.
